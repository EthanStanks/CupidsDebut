<h1> Cupid's Debut</h1>
<p>
Heart broken robots stole Cupid's wings. Help him take on their massive heartless army with the power of love and archery!
<br><br>
Auto-shooter game centered around the theme "Valentine's Day" for Valentine's Day Game Jam 2024.<br>
Solo developed using the Godot 4 engine in 3 days. This was my first time using Godot as well as finishing a game jam!<br>
